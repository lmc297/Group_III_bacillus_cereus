### ksnp3_outgroupGCF_002574215_SNPs_in_majority0.5_matrix.fasta.treefile

Maximum likelihood phylogeny constructed using majority SNPs identified among 71 emetic Group III *B. cereus s.l.* genomes 
and their closely related, non-emetic counterparts, plus outgroup genome *B. cereus s.l.* str. AFS057383. Majority SNPs were 
detected using kSNP3, and the phylogeny was constructed using IQ-TREE/ModelFinder.
